# cuDF PR #24498 versus tuned radix-prefix LRB refinement

R8 is 2.250× faster than the best fixed PR segmented/RLE setting in the complete repeated matrix across the 206 active permutation states, and 1.863× faster on the separate 16-state end-to-end sort pool. R8 wins by more than 2% in 162 of those 206 permutation states; PR mode 2 wins in 41, with three within 2%. These are equal-weight synthetic-suite results, not a universal dispatch decision.

Rebased `string-sort-prefix-variants` onto PR head `a257d75a7b5a4bb5b4ee392861d8d466e950d297`. The original `f6ba458cd0d0c399f5bf514cfa4914addc092f89` is preserved as `backup/string-sort-prefix-variants-before-pr24498-20261008`. Integration source was measured at `6e05c89801`; the complete SHA and file/binary hashes are in `provenance.json`. The branch was committed locally. No force-push was performed.

The PR segmented implementation and the saved LRB kernel/load headers are byte-identical to their controls. PR selectors 0/1/2 retain their algorithms and defaults. Selector 3 uses the prior measured winner: R8 prefix + separate row ID, bounded funnel loads, exact RLE, tiered LRB, hybrid warp sorting, 1024-row giant tiles, 32-warps-per-SM launch cap, and hierarchical merging. It has its own wrapper/namespace in `string_sort_lrb.cuh`. The historical A–F/R12 runtime selectors are archived on the backup branch. Prefix merge remains the default.

Reference: [NVIDIA/cuDF PR #24498](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cudf/pull/24498), pinned to the head above. This comparison covers the experimental single-string-column path; it does not select a new multi-column algorithm.

| Selector | Algorithm | Settings used in the main comparison |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | PR prefix merge | Unchanged default |
| 1 | PR segmented | Precision 32; cutoff 512 |
| 2 | PR segmented with terminal exact-duplicate elimination | Precision 32; cutoff 4096 |
| 3 | Tuned R8 LRB | Fixed prior winning recipe; native schedule 0 |

H100 SXM 80GB GPU 0 on `viking-prod-206`, CUDA 13.3, one serialized workload at a time. The primary comparisons use one freshly built binary and identical deterministic inputs. Every main state/configuration has three independently warmed processes with 20 samples and five warmups; job order is randomized. The reported time is the median of the three unprofiled GPU-event means. Nsight timings do not enter the rankings. The old-library control uses the same benchmark binary with `LD_PRELOAD`, and includes the upstream rebase as well as refactoring.

The preliminary tuning sweep tested both PR modes at precision 1/8/10/16 and 32, including cutoffs 128/512/4096 at precision 32, over ten representative cases (five samples each). The full repeated matrix then tested all three cutoffs at precision 32. That complete-depth budget covers the longest fixed-width shared prefixes. The table selects each PR mode's best fixed cutoff on the combined suite; it is not a per-case oracle or a universal optimum. Default precision-1 results and bounded failures are reported separately.

| Pool | States | Prefix / R8 | Best PR 1 / R8 | Best PR 2 / R8 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| original-active | 68 | 2.249 | 1.835 | 1.688 |
| segments | 48 | 3.168 | 3.920 | 3.947 |
| pr-new | 90 | 2.438 | 2.429 | 2.072 |
| combined | 206 | 2.523 | 2.475 | 2.250 |
| end-to-end | 16 | 2.445 | 2.218 | 1.863 |
| all-sorted-order | 216 | 2.438 | 2.431 | 2.218 |

Ratios are geometric means of each state's time divided by the matched R8 time; values above 1 favor R8. `original-active` excludes identity exits and true constants from the prior original suite. `segments` contains all 48 controlled distributions. `pr-new` includes PR workloads, source-parity inputs, diagnostics, and small zero-padding collisions. `combined` excludes end-to-end gathering and the ten original identity/constant cases; `all-sorted-order` includes those ten. End-to-end `sort` is separate. These synthetic pools weight states equally, not by an application's frequency.

Peak allocation counters exclude the pre-generated input and include the output permutation and temporary allocations. Every state is retained in `pr24498-timings.csv`; allocator measurements are separate from GPU-event timings.


Saved-library control: new R8 / old R8 geometric mean = 1.0003 over 126 states. 5 states were above +2% and 5 below -2%; 2% is an attention threshold, not a confidence interval. This control cannot separate the effect of unrelated upstream changes from the wrapper refactor.


Follow-up checks use three new processes of 50 samples each for all ten saved-control deviations above 2%, the nine main cases with near ties within 5% or recorded sample noise above 20% and R8 time above 0.1 ms, and the four strongest distinct PR-default wins. These checks do not replace or selectively alter the primary rankings. Round ranges and sample noise for every main state are preserved in the timings CSV. Differences near 2% should not be treated as established statistical wins.

Default checks use one warmed process with 20 samples per completed state. A process timeout includes input setup, validation, warmups and timed samples; it is not a per-sort timing or a speedup bound. Timeouts are censored and excluded from any timing ratio. See `defaults/results.json` for every state, command and result.

These default wins should guide further investigation; their single-process screening is distinct from the three-round main ranking.

Nsight reports medians across seven sampled calls, after warmup. CUDA-event total times and traced kernel sums measure different quantities; do not use this table to rank implementations. `profiles/kernels.csv` retains launch dimensions, registers, shared memory and every kernel duration.

These bounded single-process probes use 20 samples on completion. Mixed short/zero-padded values cannot prove a full next radix word; a large pass budget alone does not bound the PR comparison finish. Timeouts refer to the complete process, not a single sort.


Validation: six full SORT_TEST configurations passed 1,658 tests each (five existing unsupported-list skips plus the explicitly gated graph test). The guarded LRB string-only configuration passed 43 tests including graph replay. Additional PR cutoff configurations passed their string suites. LRB memcheck, synccheck and racecheck reported zero errors/hazards. Repository hooks and the seven-architecture build passed. The saved-library compatibility smoke passed three LRB edge/long-suffix tests. Raw logs document exact counts and skips.


Use `LIBCUDF_STRING_SORT_ALGORITHM=1` or `2` for the PR backend, and `3` for tuned R8 LRB. PR precision/cutoff settings affect only modes 1/2. Set `LIBCUDF_RADIX_LRB_STRING_SORT_SCHEDULE=2` for the LRB graph path; native schedule 0 remains the measured default. Settings are cached, so start a fresh process after changing them. Current commands are in `cpp/benchmarks/sort/README.md`.


The giant PR profile spends 152.24 of 154.40 ms (98.6%) in a CUB segmented-sort fallback with grid=1, block=256, 179 registers/thread and 33856 shared bytes. Its tiny32 profile spends 90.7% of kernel time in a 512-thread finish for 32-row runs. Native R8 uses distributed hierarchical merging and the warp tier respectively. The giant PR call has 30 stream synchronizations versus one for R8; the giant kernel itself dominates the cost.


Further directions, in order of measured relevance:

1. Add a separately selected experimental fast path for a single continuing run covering every valid row: reuse the PR global radix sorter instead of the single-block segmented fallback. The existing exact continuing-row count supplies the safety condition; inactive ranges must retain their output ownership. Measure this narrow change before generalizing to multiple large runs.
2. Try an exact, tiled common-prefix/duplicate proof for large LRB runs. Reduce the minimum proven common-prefix advance across all eligible rows, preserve short/embedded-zero length distinctions, and bypass both sorting and scratch finalization for proven identical runs. This could remove the repeated long-suffix comparisons that dominate R8 giant merging. No cardinality sketch is needed.
3. Port the LRB subgroup/block/hierarchical finish into a new hybrid backend after prefix advancement. The PR tiny32 finish is oversized for its run size; its giant comparison finish can remain expensive after partial-word or zero-padding collisions. Keep selectors 1/2 unchanged as reference controls.
4. Evaluate a three-way suffix comparator where stable warp refinement currently makes reverse comparisons, then cached or typed offset/length metadata in comparison-heavy workers. Measure register/shared-memory costs and end-to-end time rather than assuming wider records help.

These are proposals, not implemented or measured new optimizations.
